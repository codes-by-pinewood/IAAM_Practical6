\section*{Question 1}

The image has 16 slices. The aspect ratio can be defined as the ratio of total width (total number of columns) and the total height (total number of rows). In that case it is 160/140 which is 1.143. 

\section*{Question 2}


\section*{Difference Between Figure 1 and 2}

The first image is a raw image obtained before processing techniques such as thresholding, median filter and contrast stretching. Thus it looks out of focus, blurry and underexposed. The second image is the product of these image analysis methods and the original image.
